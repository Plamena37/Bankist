# Bankist

## 📝 [Bankist](https://plamena37.github.io/Bankist/) -  An overall practise on the JavaScript array methods!


> ### It has two hardcoded accounts with which you can try it 😊
> - usrname: **pi**, password: **1111**;
> - usrname: **hg**, password: **2222**; 

### The things you can do here are:
- transfering money to the other account;
- requesting a loan, which maximum value can be 10% of the highest movement in the account; 
- closing the account;

### Additional features:
- timer, which logs you out after 5 minutes;
- interest rate;
- total incomes;
- total outcomes;
- sorting the movements
